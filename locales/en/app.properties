help_flag_content=In order to avoid tapping on mines, you can flag them. To flag a cell, either change the mode to flagging mode with the mode switch above the grid or right-click or tap and hold the cell. Flagging mines also lets you automatically reveal all cells, for which all the mines surrounding them are marked, by tapping on such a cell that is already revealed.

help_keyboard_content.innerHTML=You can navigate the minefield using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Pressing <kbd>space</kbd> will perform the current default action, <kbd>F</kbd> will flag the current cell, <kbd>R</kbd> will generate a new field and <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> toggles the default action. <kbd>Pause</kbd> or <kbd>P</kbd> pauses and resumes the game and <kbd>F1</kbd> opens this help page.

help_rules_content=In Minesweeper-like games, your goal is to find all the mines in a grid. If you tap on a cell in the grid, its contents will be revealed. Of course, you don't want to reveal a mine, as it will explode and kill you. Cells next to mines show a number with the count of adjacent mines.
help_rules_title=Basic Game Mechanics
help_save_content=Every uncompleted game gets saved whenever you leave the app or go to a different part of the game. The next time you launch the app it will try to restore your game or a "Continue" button appears in the main menu while there is a saved game. As soon as a new game is started, the saved game will be deleted.
