help_title=Mines Help
help_rules_title=Basic Game Mechanics
help_rules_content=In Minesweeper-like games, your goal is to find all the mines in a grid. If you tap on a cell in the grid, its contents will be revealed. Of course, you don't want to reveal a mine, as it will explode and kill you. Cells next to mines show a number with the count of adjecent mines.
help_flag_title=Flagging Mines
help_flag_content=In order to avoid tapping on mines, you can flag them. To flag a cell, either change the mode to flagging mode with the mode button in the middle of the toolbar at the bottom of the screen or right click or tap and hold the cell. Flagging mines also lets you automatically reveal all cells, for which all the mines surrounding them are marked, by tapping on such a cell that is already revealed.
help_save_title=Saving And Resuming
help_save_content=Every uncompleted game gets saved whenever you leave the app. A "Continue" button appears in the main menu while there is a saved game. As soon as a new game is started, the saved game will be deleted.
