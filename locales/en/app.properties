help_flag_content=In order to avoid tapping on mines, you can flag them. To flag a cell, either change the mode to flagging mode with the mode button at the right end of the toolbar at the bottom of the screen or right click or tap and hold the cell. Flagging mines also lets you automatically reveal all cells, for which all the mines surrounding them are marked, by tapping on such a cell that is already revealed.

help_keyboard_content.innerHTML=You can navigate the minefield using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Pressing <kbd>space</kbd> will preform the current default action, <kbd>F</kbd> will flag the current cell, <kbd>R</kbd> will generate a new field and <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> toggles the default action.

help_rules_content=In Minesweeper-like games, your goal is to find all the mines in a grid. If you tap on a cell in the grid, its contents will be revealed. Of course, you don't want to reveal a mine, as it will explode and kill you. Cells next to mines show a number with the count of adjecent mines.
